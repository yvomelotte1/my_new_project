# Puzzl.ai = An AI Chess Puzzle Composer?
Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
An AI Chess Puzzle Composer would generate original chess problems and puzzles of varying difficulty levels for players to solve. The AI should be able to evaluate the quality and difficulty of generated puzzles, ensuring that they are solvable and have a unique solution.
## Background
The project would aim to help beginner chess players to learn the fundamentals of the game and to help them improve their tactial and spacial awareness in chess. Chess is currently one of the fastest-growing games in the world, and so an AI chess puzzle composer would be a very useful tool for beginner chess players in the journey to improvement. This project motivates me because I am currently working to improve chess elo rating and I believe that such a tool would help those learning to play chess improve at a much faster rate than was possible before.
## How is it used?
The model for the AI chess puzzle composer would be embedded into a website or an application that allows users to complete selected chess puzzles. Development to the model could introduce active recall as a tool to help users concentrate on puzzles they consistently struggle with.
## Data sources and AI methods
The data that would be used for the AI model's training set has already been collected through thousands of online chess games. Selected tactics from each of these games would provide useful information in training an AI model that would use all of the techniques we have learnt about in the Building AI course.
## Challenges
The chess market is already very saturated. Larger competitors such as Chess.com already control a large proportion of the online chess market, meaning that gaining traction in the chess world make be more difficult.
## What next?
The next steps in the creation of this project would be to find a team of individuals with advanced coding and machine learning skills to develop and publish the project. Another step that could be taken would be to start a social media page concentrating on chess. This page would help to create a close-knit community of chess players who would positively respond to the launch of the project and the AI model.
